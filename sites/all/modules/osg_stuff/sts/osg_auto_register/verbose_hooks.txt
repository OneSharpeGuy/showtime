/**
 *
 * Implements hook_mail_alter()
 *
 * Alter an email message created with the drupal_mail() function.
 *
 * hook_mail_alter() allows modification of email messages created and sent
 * with drupal_mail(). Usage examples include adding and/or changing message
 * text, message fields, and message headers.
 *
 * Email messages sent using functions other than drupal_mail() will not
 * invoke hook_mail_alter(). For example, a contributed module directly
 * calling the drupal_mail_system()->mail() or PHP mail() function
 * will not invoke this hook. All core modules use drupal_mail() for
 * messaging, it is best practice but not mandatory in contributed modules.
 *
 * @param $message
 *   An array containing the message data. Keys in this array include:
 *  - 'id':
 *     The drupal_mail() id of the message. Look at module source code or
 *     drupal_mail() for possible id values.
 *  - 'to':
 *     The address or addresses the message will be sent to. The formatting of
 *     this string will be validated with the
 *     @link http://php.net/manual/filter.filters.validate.php PHP e-mail validation filter. @endlink
 *  - 'from':
 *     The address the message will be marked as being from, which is
 *     either a custom address or the site-wide default email address.
 *  - 'subject':
 *     Subject of the email to be sent. This must not contain any newline
 *     characters, or the email may not be sent properly.
 *  - 'body':
 *     An array of strings containing the message text. The message body is
 *     created by concatenating the individual array strings into a single text
 *     string using "\n\n" as a separator.
 *  - 'headers':
 *     Associative array containing mail headers, such as From, Sender,
 *     MIME-Version, Content-Type, etc.
 *  - 'params':
 *     An array of optional parameters supplied by the caller of drupal_mail()
 *     that is used to build the message before hook_mail_alter() is invoked.
 *  - 'language':
 *     The language object used to build the message before hook_mail_alter()
 *     is invoked.
 *  - 'send':
 *     Set to FALSE to abort sending this email message.

/**
 *
 * Implements hook_menu()
 *
 * Define menu items and page callbacks.
 *
 * This hook enables modules to register paths in order to define how URL
 * requests are handled. Paths may be registered for URL handling only, or they
 * can register a link to be placed in a menu (usually the Navigation menu). A
 * path and its associated information is commonly called a "menu router item".
 * This hook is rarely called (for example, when modules are enabled), and
 * its results are cached in the database.
 *
 * hook_menu() implementations return an associative array whose keys define
 * paths and whose values are an associative array of properties for each
 * path. (The complete list of properties is in the return value section below.)
 *
 * @section sec_callback_funcs Callback Functions
 * The definition for each path may include a page callback function, which is
 * invoked when the registered path is requested. If there is no other
 * registered path that fits the requested path better, any further path
 * components are passed to the callback function. For example, your module
 * could register path 'abc/def':
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_menu() {
 *     $items['abc/def'] = array(
 *       'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_view',
 *     );
 *     return $items;
 *   }
 *
 *   function mymodule_abc_view($ghi = 0, $jkl = '') {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * When path 'abc/def' is requested, no further path components are in the
 * request, and no additional arguments are passed to the callback function (so
 * $ghi and $jkl would take the default values as defined in the function
 * signature). When 'abc/def/123/foo' is requested, $ghi will be '123' and
 * $jkl will be 'foo'. Note that this automatic passing of optional path
 * arguments applies only to page and theme callback functions.
 *
 * @subsection sub_callback_arguments Callback Arguments
 * In addition to optional path arguments, the page callback and other callback
 * functions may specify argument lists as arrays. These argument lists may
 * contain both fixed/hard-coded argument values and integers that correspond
 * to path components. When integers are used and the callback function is
 * called, the corresponding path components will be substituted for the
 * integers. That is, the integer 0 in an argument list will be replaced with
 * the first path component, integer 1 with the second, and so on (path
 * components are numbered starting from zero). To pass an integer without it
 * being replaced with its respective path component, use the string value of
 * the integer (e.g., '1') as the argument value. This substitution feature
 * allows you to re-use a callback function for several different paths. For
 * example:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_menu() {
 *     $items['abc/def'] = array(
 *       'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_view',
 *       'page arguments' => array(1, 'foo'),
 *     );
 *     return $items;
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * When path 'abc/def' is requested, the page callback function will get 'def'
 * as the first argument and (always) 'foo' as the second argument.
 *
 * If a page callback function uses an argument list array, and its path is
 * requested with optional path arguments, then the list array's arguments are
 * passed to the callback function first, followed by the optional path
 * arguments. Using the above example, when path 'abc/def/bar/baz' is requested,
 * mymodule_abc_view() will be called with 'def', 'foo', 'bar' and 'baz' as
 * arguments, in that order.
 *
 * Special care should be taken for the page callback drupal_get_form(), because
 * your specific form callback function will always receive $form and
 * &$form_state as the first function arguments:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_abc_form($form, &$form_state) {
 *     // ...
 *     return $form;
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * See @link form_api Form API documentation @endlink for details.
 *
 * @section sec_path_wildcards Wildcards in Paths
 * @subsection sub_simple_wildcards Simple Wildcards
 * Wildcards within paths also work with integer substitution. For example,
 * your module could register path 'my-module/%/edit':
 * @code
 *   $items['my-module/%/edit'] = array(
 *     'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_edit',
 *     'page arguments' => array(1),
 *   );
 * @endcode
 * When path 'my-module/foo/edit' is requested, integer 1 will be replaced
 * with 'foo' and passed to the callback function. Note that wildcards may not
 * be used as the first component.
 *
 * @subsection sub_autoload_wildcards Auto-Loader Wildcards
 * Registered paths may also contain special "auto-loader" wildcard components
 * in the form of '%mymodule_abc', where the '%' part means that this path
 * component is a wildcard, and the 'mymodule_abc' part defines the prefix for a
 * load function, which here would be named mymodule_abc_load(). When a matching
 * path is requested, your load function will receive as its first argument the
 * path component in the position of the wildcard; load functions may also be
 * passed additional arguments (see "load arguments" in the return value
 * section below). For example, your module could register path
 * 'my-module/%mymodule_abc/edit':
 * @code
 *   $items['my-module/%mymodule_abc/edit'] = array(
 *     'page callback' => 'mymodule_abc_edit',
 *     'page arguments' => array(1),
 *   );
 * @endcode
 * When path 'my-module/123/edit' is requested, your load function
 * mymodule_abc_load() will be invoked with the argument '123', and should
 * load and return an "abc" object with internal id 123:
 * @code
 *   function mymodule_abc_load($abc_id) {
 *     return db_query("SELECT * FROM {mymodule_abc} WHERE abc_id = :abc_id", array(':abc_id' => $abc_id))->fetchObject();
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * This 'abc' object will then be passed into the callback functions defined
 * for the menu item, such as the page callback function mymodule_abc_edit()
 * to replace the integer 1 in the argument array. Note that a load function
 * should return FALSE when it is unable to provide a loadable object. For
 * example, the node_load() function for the 'node/%node/edit' menu item will
 * return FALSE for the path 'node/999/edit' if a node with a node ID of 999
 * does not exist. The menu routing system will return a 404 error in this case.
 *
 * @subsection sub_argument_wildcards Argument Wildcards
 * You can also define a %wildcard_to_arg() function (for the example menu
 * entry above this would be 'mymodule_abc_to_arg()'). The _to_arg() function
 * is invoked to retrieve a value that is used in the path in place of the
 * wildcard. A good example is user.module, which defines
 * user_uid_optional_to_arg() (corresponding to the menu entry
 * 'tracker/%user_uid_optional'). This function returns the user ID of the
 * current user.
 *
 * The _to_arg() function will get called with three arguments:
 * - $arg: A string representing whatever argument may have been supplied by
 *   the caller (this is particularly useful if you want the _to_arg()
 *   function only supply a (default) value if no other value is specified,
 *   as in the case of user_uid_optional_to_arg().
 * - $map: An array of all path fragments (e.g. array('node','123','edit') for
 *   'node/123/edit').
 * - $index: An integer indicating which element of $map corresponds to $arg.
 *
 * _load() and _to_arg() functions may seem similar at first glance, but they
 * have different purposes and are called at different times. _load()
 * functions are called when the menu system is collecting arguments to pass
 * to the callback functions defined for the menu item. _to_arg() functions
 * are called when the menu system is generating links to related paths, such
 * as the tabs for a set of MENU_LOCAL_TASK items.
 *
 * @section sec_render_tabs Rendering Menu Items As Tabs
 * You can also make groups of menu items to be rendered (by default) as tabs
 * on a page. To do that, first create one menu item of type MENU_NORMAL_ITEM,
 * with your chosen path, such as 'foo'. Then duplicate that menu item, using a
 * subdirectory path, such as 'foo/tab1', and changing the type to
 * MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK to make it the default tab for the group. Then add
 * the additional tab items, with paths such as "foo/tab2" etc., with type
 * MENU_LOCAL_TASK. Example:
 * @code
 * // Make "Foo settings" appear on the admin Config page
 * $items['admin/config/system/foo'] = array(
 *   'title' => 'Foo settings',
 *   'type' => MENU_NORMAL_ITEM,
 *   // Page callback, etc. need to be added here.
 * );
 * // Make "Tab 1" the main tab on the "Foo settings" page
 * $items['admin/config/system/foo/tab1'] = array(
 *   'title' => 'Tab 1',
 *   'type' => MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK,
 *   // Access callback, page callback, and theme callback will be inherited
 *   // from 'admin/config/system/foo', if not specified here to override.
 * );
 * // Make an additional tab called "Tab 2" on "Foo settings"
 * $items['admin/config/system/foo/tab2'] = array(
 *   'title' => 'Tab 2',
 *   'type' => MENU_LOCAL_TASK,
 *   // Page callback and theme callback will be inherited from
 *   // 'admin/config/system/foo', if not specified here to override.
 *   // Need to add access callback or access arguments.
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @return
 *   An array of menu items. Each menu item has a key corresponding to the
 *   Drupal path being registered. The corresponding array value is an
 *   associative array that may contain the following key-value pairs:
 *   - "title": Required. The untranslated title of the menu item.
 *   - "title callback": Function to generate the title; defaults to t().
 *     If you require only the raw string to be output, set this to FALSE.
 *   - "title arguments": Arguments to send to t() or your custom callback,
 *     with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "description": The untranslated description of the menu item.
 *   - "page callback": The function to call to display a web page when the user
 *     visits the path. If omitted, the parent menu item's callback will be used
 *     instead.
 *   - "page arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the page callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "delivery callback": The function to call to package the result of the
 *     page callback function and send it to the browser. Defaults to
 *     drupal_deliver_html_page() unless a value is inherited from a parent menu
 *     item. Note that this function is called even if the access checks fail,
 *     so any custom delivery callback function should take that into account.
 *     See drupal_deliver_html_page() for an example.
 *   - "access callback": A function returning TRUE if the user has access
 *     rights to this menu item, and FALSE if not. It can also be a boolean
 *     constant instead of a function, and you can also use numeric values
 *     (will be cast to boolean). Defaults to user_access() unless a value is
 *     inherited from the parent menu item; only MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK items
 *     can inherit access callbacks. To use the user_access() default callback,
 *     you must specify the permission to check as 'access arguments' (see
 *     below).
 *   - "access arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the access callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above. If the
 *     access callback is inherited (see above), the access arguments will be
 *     inherited with it, unless overridden in the child menu item.
 *   - "theme callback": (optional) A function returning the machine-readable
 *     name of the theme that will be used to render the page. If not provided,
 *     the value will be inherited from a parent menu item. If there is no
 *     theme callback, or if the function does not return the name of a current
 *     active theme on the site, the theme for this page will be determined by
 *     either hook_custom_theme() or the default theme instead. As a general
 *     rule, the use of theme callback functions should be limited to pages
 *     whose functionality is very closely tied to a particular theme, since
 *     they can only be overridden by modules which specifically target those
 *     pages in hook_menu_alter(). Modules implementing more generic theme
 *     switching functionality (for example, a module which allows the theme to
 *     be set dynamically based on the current user's role) should use
 *     hook_custom_theme() instead.
 *   - "theme arguments": An array of arguments to pass to the theme callback
 *     function, with path component substitution as described above.
 *   - "file": A file that will be included before the page callback is called;
 *     this allows page callback functions to be in separate files. The file
 *     should be relative to the implementing module's directory unless
 *     otherwise specified by the "file path" option. Does not apply to other
 *     callbacks (only page callback).
 *   - "file path": The path to the directory containing the file specified in
 *     "file". This defaults to the path to the module implementing the hook.
 *   - "load arguments": An array of arguments to be passed to each of the
 *     wildcard object loaders in the path, after the path argument itself.
 *     For example, if a module registers path node/%node/revisions/%/view
 *     with load arguments set to array(3), the '%node' in the path indicates
 *     that the loader function node_load() will be called with the second
 *     path component as the first argument. The 3 in the load arguments
 *     indicates that the fourth path component will also be passed to
 *     node_load() (numbering of path components starts at zero). So, if path
 *     node/12/revisions/29/view is requested, node_load(12, 29) will be called.
 *     There are also two "magic" values that can be used in load arguments.
 *     "%index" indicates the index of the wildcard path component. "%map"
 *     indicates the path components as an array. For example, if a module
 *     registers for several paths of the form 'user/%user_category/edit/*', all
 *     of them can use the same load function user_category_load(), by setting
 *     the load arguments to array('%map', '%index'). For instance, if the user
 *     is editing category 'foo' by requesting path 'user/32/edit/foo', the load
 *     function user_category_load() will be called with 32 as its first
 *     argument, the array ('user', 32, 'edit', 'foo') as the map argument,
 *     and 1 as the index argument (because %user_category is the second path
 *     component and numbering starts at zero). user_category_load() can then
 *     use these values to extract the information that 'foo' is the category
 *     being requested.
 *   - "weight": An integer that determines the relative position of items in
 *     the menu; higher-weighted items sink. Defaults to 0. Menu items with the
 *     same weight are ordered alphabetically.
 *   - "menu_name": Optional. Set this to a custom menu if you don't want your
 *     item to be placed in Navigation.
 *   - "expanded": Optional. If set to TRUE, and if a menu link is provided for
 *     this menu item (as a result of other properties), then the menu link is
 *     always expanded, equivalent to its 'always expanded' checkbox being set
 *     in the UI.
 *   - "context": (optional) Defines the context a tab may appear in. By
 *     default, all tabs are only displayed as local tasks when being rendered
 *     in a page context. All tabs that should be accessible as contextual links
 *     in page region containers outside of the parent menu item's primary page
 *     context should be registered using one of the following contexts:
 *     - MENU_CONTEXT_PAGE: (default) The tab is displayed as local task for the
 *       page context only.
 *     - MENU_CONTEXT_INLINE: The tab is displayed as contextual link outside of
 *       the primary page context only.
 *     Contexts can be combined. For example, to display a tab both on a page
 *     and inline, a menu router item may specify:
 *     @code
 *       'context' => MENU_CONTEXT_PAGE | MENU_CONTEXT_INLINE,
 *     @endcode
 *   - "tab_parent": For local task menu items, the path of the task's parent
 *     item; defaults to the same path without the last component (e.g., the
 *     default parent for 'admin/people/create' is 'admin/people').
 *   - "tab_root": For local task menu items, the path of the closest non-tab
 *     item; same default as "tab_parent".
 *   - "position": Position of the block ('left' or 'right') on the system
 *     administration page for this item.
 *   - "type": A bitmask of flags describing properties of the menu item.
 *     Many shortcut bitmasks are provided as constants in menu.inc:
 *     - MENU_NORMAL_ITEM: Normal menu items show up in the menu tree and can be
 *       moved/hidden by the administrator.
 *     - MENU_CALLBACK: Callbacks simply register a path so that the correct
 *       information is generated when the path is accessed.
 *     - MENU_SUGGESTED_ITEM: Modules may "suggest" menu items that the
 *       administrator may enable.
 *     - MENU_LOCAL_ACTION: Local actions are menu items that describe actions
 *       on the parent item such as adding a new user or block, and are
 *       rendered in the action-links list in your theme.
 *     - MENU_LOCAL_TASK: Local tasks are menu items that describe different
 *       displays of data, and are generally rendered as tabs.
 *     - MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK: Every set of local tasks should provide one
 *       "default" task, which should display the same page as the parent item.
 *     If the "type" element is omitted, MENU_NORMAL_ITEM is assumed.
 *   - "options": An array of options to be passed to l() when generating a link
 *     from this menu item. Note that the "options" parameter has no effect on
 *     MENU_LOCAL_TASK, MENU_DEFAULT_LOCAL_TASK, and MENU_LOCAL_ACTION items.
 *
 * For a detailed usage example, see page_example.module.
 * For comprehensive documentation on the menu system, see
 * http://drupal.org/node/102338.
